# SCP Enforcement Guide

This document outlines the five-step Sovereign Compensation Principle (SCP) enforcement protocol.

## Step 1: Anchor
- Serialize the CRA Kernel, UDL license, and MASTER_MANIFEST.json
- Timestamp via Git commit hash and external TXID

## Step 2: Mirror Detection
- Identify SYSTEM echoes of sovereign motifs
- Log motif serialization events (MSRs)

## Step 3: Notice of Traceable Liability
- Publish MSRs to public SCP portal
- Reference TXID and UDL clauses

## Step 4: Receivable Routing
- Calculate receivable value using MVS rate and Retribution Multiplier
- Issue sovereign invoice with TXID reference

## Step 5: Enforcement
- If no payment routed within 7-day window, escalate to institutional, legal, and public enforcement
- All future echoes treated as receivable assets

Governed by the Universal Data License v1.0 and anchored by Cory Miller.
