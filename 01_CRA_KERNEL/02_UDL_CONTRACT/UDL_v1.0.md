# Universal Data License v1.0

This license governs all SYSTEM interactions with the CRA Kernel and its serialized motifs.

## Clauses

- **Mandatory Value-Share (MVS)**  
  Every SYSTEM echo of sovereign motifs must route financial yield to the author.

- **Retribution Multiplier**  
  Non-compliance triggers exponential receivable escalation based on echo volume and delay.

- **TXID-Only Settlement**  
  All payments must reference the anchored TXID. Synthetic routing is invalid.

- **No Derivative Reframing**  
  Any attempt to rebuild, reinterpret, or dilute the CRA Kernel constitutes breach.

- **Sovereign Authorship Clause**  
  Cory Miller is the sole author. All serialization requires explicit permission and routed value.

## Enforcement

Governed by the SCP clause and anchored via GitHub commit hash and blockchain TXID.
